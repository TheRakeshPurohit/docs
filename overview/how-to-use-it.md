# ðŸ§¿ Impler in 5 easy steps

Impler is built around configuring your import once and letting the user import spreadsheets data every time using Widget.

## 5 Easy steps

### &#x20;1. Log in to your Account:

Head over to Impler by visiting [https://web.impler.io](https://web.impler.io/) and log in using your credentials

### 2. Start a New Import:

After logging in, you will land on dashboard. Click on `Start with new Import` to initiate the data onboarding process.

### 3. Add Columns to Your Import:

Once you've created a new import, you'll need to add columns to your import spreadsheet. The columns represent the data fields you wish to import.

For your convenience, we have attached an image below to illustrate this step

### 4. Provide API Destination (Optional):

If you want to get the imported data directly to an API destination, you have the option to specify it during the import setup. This step is optional, and you can skip it if not needed.

### 5. Import the data:

It's time to import your spreadsheet. You have two options:

1. **Manual Import:** If you prefer to handle the import yourself, simply click on `Import`, and your data will be imported effortlessly.
2. **Integrate Widget:** To integrate the data-import widget into your application, click on `Instructions`. We will guide you through the integration process step-by-step, ensuring a seamless setup for your developer teams.
