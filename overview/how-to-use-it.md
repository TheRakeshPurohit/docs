# ðŸ§¿ How to use it? In 5 steps

Impler is built around configuring your import once and letting the user import spreadsheet data every time using Widget.

## 5 Easy Steps

### &#x20;1. Log in to your Account:

Head over to Impler by visiting [https://web.impler.io](https://web.impler.io/) and log in using your credentials

### 2. Create a New Import:

After logging in, you will land on the dashboard. Click on `Create Import` which will open the create modal asking you to give the appropriate name to the Import.

### 3. Add Columns to Your Import:

Once you've created a new import, you need to add columns to your import spreadsheet. The columns represent the data fields you wish to import.

The image represents a few fields and a button to add a new field.

### 4. Provide API Destination (Optional):

You can send Imported data to your backend application or Bubble.io application.

Enable `Webhook` destination and provide a REST api endpoint in case you want to send imported data to your application.

### 5. Import the data:

It's time to import your CSV or Excel file. We can do it in two ways:

1. **Import from Dashboard:** You can click on `Import` the button and the import widget will be opened. Which allows you to use data import functionality without any extra configuration.
2. **Embed Widget into Application:** You can embed CSV Excel Import widget into your application too, regardless of which tech stack you're using. Follow the steps mentioned in `Snippet` section of Importer, to embed a widget into your application. Read more in [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
