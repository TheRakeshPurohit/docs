<summary>If I use Axios in my custom validator, will it pass the cookies from my logged-in user to my server, or is the validator call being made from Impler's servers?</summary>

<summary>Is there any way to access user uploaded file?</summary>

Yes, Impler provides a REST API endpoint to fetch a user-uploaded file. Here is CURL,

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.impler.io/v1/upload/:uploadId/files/original' \
--header 'accesskey: <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

You can get `:uploadId` using `Upload Complete` event and `ACCESS_TOKEN` will be available from the Settings panel.

API will send a file with headers `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` as values for file type and filename respectively.
