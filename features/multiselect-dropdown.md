### iii. Enabling Multiselect Dropdown using [Runtime Schema](runtime-schema.md)

We can enable the Multiselect feature by providing a custom schema with the `allowMultiSelect` flag in our frontend code.

```javascript
showWidget({
  schema: [
    {
      key: 'choice',
      name: 'Eating Choice',
      type: 'Select',
      selectValues: ['Fruit', 'Vegetables', 'Nuts'],
      allowMultiSelect: true
    }
  ]
});

```

## Sample file generation and format

Impler creates `.xlsx` and `.xlsm` files based on the columns' configuration:

* **.xlsx File**: Generated if no columns have Multiselect enabled.
* **.xlsm File**: Generated if any column has Multiselect enabled.

### Writing in .xlsm Files

When a column is marked as Multiselect, Impler appends `#MULTI` to the end of the column name in the Excel file. This allows users to select multiple options in the cell.

For detailed steps on how to write in `.xlsm` files, refer to [writing-effectively-into-.xlsm-files.md](../additional-resources/writing-effectively-into-.xlsm-files.md "mention").

## Data Format

Columns with the Multiselect feature will send an array of selected values when sent to the user via webhook.

## Summary

The Multiselect feature is a powerful tool that enhances the flexibility of data selection in Impler. By either using the web portal or custom schema, users can easily enable this feature to accommodate various use cases. The distinction between `.xlsx` and `.xlsm` files ensures that the data is correctly processed and displayed according to the column configurations.
