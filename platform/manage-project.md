# Manage Project

Projects in Impler play a vital role in organizing imports effectively. You can invite your peers to the team and collaborate on Imports.

## How Projects Work?

### Open Projects Modal

Click on your project name on the top left corner of the Impler platform below the Impler logo to open Projects Modal.

### Create Project

You can create unlimited projects in Impler. To create a new project write the project name in text input and click on `Create`. Upon creating a project you will be switched to a new project automatically.

### Switch Project

Once the project is created it will be shown on the projects menu. As `Owner` only you can delete the project.
