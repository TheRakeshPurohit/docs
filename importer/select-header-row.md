  Need to import a file that doesn't have a header or data starting after a few
  rows? Choose to import the file with headers or select the header row from
  where the data is starting.

# Select Header Row

### How it works?

*   Open the Importer and select the file you want to import.

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Import file</p></figcaption></figure>
*   `Select Header` step will be opened. Which shows the first 15 rows for header selection. You can select the Header row of your choice or continue importing without headers by clicking on `File does not have headers`.\

*   Mapping will be based on the selected header row. Rows above the header row will not be imported.

* In the case of importing files without headers, the first row will be shown in the Mapping Step.
